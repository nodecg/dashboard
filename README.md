## Why?
Some people might like this better? That's a great question, honestly.

## Installation
Check the [Releases](https://github.com/nodecg/dashboard/releases) page to grab the latest installer for your operating system.
Once installed, the application will autoupdate.

### NOTICE
Due to a bug in Squirrel.Windows, the installer currently generates broken shortcuts on Windows.
To fix the shortcut, do the following:

1. Right-click on the shortcut and click "Properties"
2. In the "Target" box, scroll to the end and wrap `NodeCG Dashboard.exe` in quotes (`"NodeCG Dashboard.exe"`).
3. Click "OK"
